# Spreadsheet Analysis (CFG Python & Apps)
This script takes monthly sales and expenditure data across a year, extracts and graphs additional info such as monthly percentage changes, and updates the spreadsheet with new info.  
This was my submission for the project component of the Python & Apps course run by CodeFirstGirls, which I completed in a group with two other students.
