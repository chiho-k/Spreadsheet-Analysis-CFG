# Spreadsheet Analysis (CFG Python & Apps)
This script takes monthly sales and expenditure data across a year, extracts further information, graphs some of this data and updates the spreadsheet with the calculated outcomes.  
This was my submission for the project component of the Python & Apps course run by CodeFirstGirls, which I completed in a group with two other students.
